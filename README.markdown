# Declarative Lookup Rollup Summaries (DLRS) Sprint Repo
See main DLRS Development repo here (https://github.com/SFDO-Community/declarative-lookup-rollup-summaries)

# Project Overview
## Vision & Goals
The DLRS Documentation and UX Working Groups want to make DLRS easier for admins to install and configure, and to enable users with a wide range of skill level to write rollups successfully. To this end, at the Sprint, we will be working on two projects:
* 1 - Compiling a **Cookbook of DLRS Recipes**, especially with examples for nonprofit users.
* 2 - Collect feedback via a **UX Survey** from users about their experience with configuring the tool, and suggestions for improvements.

# Past Project Teams
We recommend creating a Wiki page for past Sprint Event volunteers (per Sprint), and that Sprints goals, accomplishments, etc. Here's a good example: https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/DataGenerationToolkit. If you prefer to add this information to the readme file, here's a good example of formatting you can use: https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Admin-Skills-and-Nonprofit-Salesforce-Teams
